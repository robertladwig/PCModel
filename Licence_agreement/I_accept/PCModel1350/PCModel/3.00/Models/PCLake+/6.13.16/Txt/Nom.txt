"The model variables have been named according to an easy-to-read system of nomenclature, so"									
"that the type, unit and meaning of a variable can be derived directly from its name. This system"									
is used throughout this chapter and in the model code. The basic system is as follows:									
type + element + process + component + layer (+ suffix)									
– State variables: s + element + compartment + layer (+ 0)									
(state) (D/P/N/Si/O2) (IM/Det/PO4/NH4/Phyt/Zoo/etc.) (W/S) (-/IC)									
- Processes (fluxes): t/w + element + process + compartment + layer									
(flux) (D/P/N/Si/O2) (Set/Min/etc.) (IM/Det/PO4/NO3/Phyt/etc.) (W/S)
